# These are used in several places. You likely want to enter whatever CSS media queries your site
# uses here.
media_queries:
  mobile: "max-width: 480px"

presets:
  # This entry is purely an example. It is not the default JPT preset, nor is it available as a
  # built-in.
  default:
    formats: [webp, original] # Order matters!
    widths: [200, 400, 600, 800, 1600] # Image widths, in pixels.

    # The sizes attribute is both important, and impossible to offer good defaults for. You need to
    # learn about it. Short version: Web browsers parse web pages line-by-line. When they run into
    # an external asset they must download, they start that process immediately, without waiting to
    # finish rendering the page. This means that at the point in time when the browser must decide
    # which image to download, it has no clue how large that image will be on the page. The sizes
    # attribute is how we tell it.
    #
    # If you do not provide this, the web browser will assume the image is 100vw (100% the width of
    # the viewport.)
    #
    # This doesn't have to be pixel-perfect, just close enough for the browser to make a good
    # choice. Keys are media queries defined above, values are how large the image will be when
    # that media query is true. You can't use % (percentage width of the parent container) for the
    # same reason we have to do this at all.
    sizes:
      mobile: 100vw
      tablet: 80vw

    # Size is unconditional; provided either after all conditional sizes (above) or alone. If you
    # only have a 'size' (no 'sizes'), and it's a constant (px, em, or rem), you should use a
    # pixel-ratio srcset.
    size: 800px

    # You can add any HTML attribute you like, to any HTML element which JPT creates:
    attributes:
      # parent refers to the outermost tag; <picture> if it's present, otherwise the <img>.
      # parent: 'data-downloadable="true"'
      # picture: 'class="awesome" data-volume="11"'
      img: 'loading="lazy"'
      # a: 'class="image-link"'

  # You can use this as jpt-webp. All following presets follow the same pattern.
  webp:
    formats: [webp, original]

  # Avif is the new hotness coming down the pipe. Browser support is bad and they are slow to
  # generate, but you get good file sizes even compared to webp of similar quality.
  avif:
    formats: [avif, webp, original]

  # Your build times will suffer, but everyone is happy.
